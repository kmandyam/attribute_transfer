A Redone Version of Delete, Retrieve, Generate using AllenNLP

- Design Elements
    - Delete should still be pre-processing
        - We start by implementing n-gram delete
    - Retrieve should use
        - Euclidean distance during test time
        - The same from the paper during train time
        - Could potentially be a pre-processing step
    - Generate
        - Use the LM based beam search
        - Use GRUs instead of LSTMs
    - Ability to test in both directions (negative to positive and positive to negative)

- Attempt #1
    - Implement DeleteOnly model
