A Redone Version of Delete, Retrieve, Generate using AllenNLP

- Design Elements
    - Delete should still be pre-processing
        - We start by implementing n-gram delete
    - Retrieve should use
        - Euclidean distance during test time
        - The same from the paper during train time
        - Could potentially be a pre-processing step
    - Generate
        - Use the LM based beam search for Delete Retrieve model
        - Use GRUs instead of LSTMs
    - Ability to test in both directions (negative to positive and positive to negative)

- Attempt #1
    - Implement DeleteOnly model
        - It looks like we're going to have to write our own encoder decoder model from scratch
        - In the DO model, we have two inputs, the content and the attribute embedding
            - both of these are learned embeddings, one is from an RNN, the other can be an embedding
        - We want to output a sequence of tokens using a decoder
            - This decoder will try to output
